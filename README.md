# ml-model-training-steps
These are the steps that I am following in order addressing a problem to solve with machine learning approaches.

1. Understand the problem
2. Go through the dataset, get some awareness about the features and target feature
3. Use pandas, seaborn, matplotlib and analyze the data
4. Identify the missing values and handle those
5. Identify outliers and handle those
6. Check for the balance and imbalance situation in the dataset and handle it
7. Data encoding (Label encoding, one hot encoding)
8. Try out different ML classification or regression algorithms
9. Evaluate the models
10. Use cross validation and analyze the consistency of the models
11. Hyper parameter tuning
12. Try out feature importance and evaluate models

I am myself a researcher in this domain and would like to explore more in the journey. Always open for any feedbacks. So all are invited to educate me.
